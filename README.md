# Autonomic Tasco League
 Hackocracy 2020
Autonomic means “ Self ”, Tasco means  “ a kind of clay for making melting pots “ and League means “ a group of teams competing against each other ”.

So, Our project is about self tesing and exploring the new skills in ourself. This can be achieved by competing with others in our created platform for Atma Nirbhar Bharat.
Our project Autonomic Tasco League (ATL) is a step to provide a free and trusted platform to provide Indians specialization in their talent. This will also help in the growth of economy by regulating capital within the country.

                    Themes for the project
Atma Nirbhar Bharat:
Atmanirbhar Bharat, which translates to 'self-reliant India' or 'self-sufficient India', is the vision of the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi of making India "a bigger and more important part of the global economy", pursuing policies that are efficient, competitive and resilient, and being self-sustaining and self-generating.
Our project Autonomic Tasco League (ATL) is a step to provide a free and trusted platform to provide Indians specialization in their talent. This will also help in the growth of economy by regulating capital within the country. If this project is expanded and made a government initiave towards education then this can help the youth to get and create jobs, be confident in interviews and even qualify as a mentor themselves.
This will also provide a platform for students to interact with people of their desired field.Post Covid World:
The outbreak of COVID-19 brought social and economic life to a standstill. Rupee is continuously depreciating. MSMEs will undergo a severe cash crunch.  Their worries primarily were loss of job, daily ration, and absence of a social security net. 
As lots of people are loosing their jobs or are insecure about their income, the system will provide a platform to acquire specialization in their skills free of cost and will also allow them to connect to people and switch in jobs to curb their insecurities.
To ease the difficulties of the migrant labourers and farmers who have suffered the most during the lockdown imposed due to coronavirus pandemic.
To promote Vocal-for-Local campaign by promoting goods and services on local scale.
